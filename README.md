#  CKEditor 5 - Drupalbreaks


## Introduction
With this module you can insert a dividing line that divides the editor into teaser and body.
This is a migration from <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor_drupalbreaks"> CKEditor 4 Drupalbreaks </a> made by <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/lukasss"> lukasss </a> to CKEditor 5 and Drupal 10.
The need for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/fakeobjects">FakeObjects</a> is no longer necessary with the programmatic restructuring of CKEditor from a procedural to an object-oriented programming style.
It includes a filter plugin for converting to an HTML break using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/render-api/the-drupal-8-render-pipeline">Drupal render pipeline</a>.

## Requirements
CKEditor 5 (core)

## Note:
This is my final project for my studies in software development and was created with the cooperation of <a href="https://erdfisch.de/">erdfisch</a>.
The release window should be within the week from May 22nd to May 25th.
